# JVM Utils

A simple utility for interacting with the [Attach API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/attach/spec/com/sun/tools/attach/package-summary.html) to load [Java Agents](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html "Oracle JavaDocs for the Instrumentation package") into a runing JVM.

## Build Instructions

The build uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) which means you don't have to do much, just run:

    ./gradlew clean build
